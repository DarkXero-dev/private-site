## New Design

After rocking the same old, now *deprecated* **Hugo Theme** for what feels like forever, I finally decided it’s time to shake things up. I switched to a theme that’s still actively maintained. Sure, it might not be as flashy or *sexy* as the old one, but man, it’s way easier to keep in shape.

I’m a big fan of **Hugo**, so no chance I’m ever dropping it.

## Main Problem

Here’s the kicker though, I just can’t seem to find a ton of cool themes for Hugo. The ones on the official [**Hugo Themes**](https://themes.gohugo.io) site are mostly basic and kinda ancient. It’s like searching for a unicorn in a haystack when you want something fresh and modern.

So, if any of you have stumbled across a clean, simple, and up-to-date Hugo theme, please throw it my way!

Oh, and don’t bother suggesting the [**Blowfish Theme**](https://blowfish.page/). I’m already using that on [**XeroLinux**](https://xerolinux.xyz), and it’s just not what I’m hunting for.

## Wrapping It Up

Switching up my theme feels like upgrading my rig—sometimes less flashy but smoother and way more reliable. Hugo rocks, but finding fresh themes? Not so much yet. So, if you’ve got any secret gems hiding in the wild, let’s geek out together and share the love!
