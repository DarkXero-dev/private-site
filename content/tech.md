I have a ridiculous number of machines covering everything from high-powered development rigs to compact home servers and retro gaming setups.

**The Beast :**

This is my main rig, the one I do all my *Development*, *Gaming* and other things on, which I label as **StationXero**. It runs **XeroLinux** in dual boot with **Windows 11**.

I use the former 99% of the time and the latter 1% only to play games, which I rarely do since am so busy. Reason I prefer gaming on **Windows** is because I like using *Trainers*. Not gonna describe what those are here, just *Google it* as the saying goes.

Anyways, this machine was recently upgraded to an `RX 7800XT` and a `Ryzen 9 5950X`. I also use the **Wayland** session on the daily. I am enjoying it so much better now.

I am not gonna list the rest of them here, it would be overwhelming, so if you want to dive into the full specs of the other machines I got, and see exactly what Iâ€™m working with, check out the [**XeroLinux Site**](https://xerolinux.xyz/gear/).
