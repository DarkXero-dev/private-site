I have a ridiculous number of machines covering everything from high-powered development rigs to compact home servers and retro gaming setups.

**The Beast :**

Main rig, the one I do all my *Development*, *Gaming* and other things on, which I label as **StationXero**.

It was recently upgraded to an `RX 7800XT` and a `Ryzen 9 5950X`. I now use **KDE Wayland** on the daily. I am enjoying it so much better now.

I am not gonna list the rest of them here, it would be overwhelming, so if you want to dive into the full specs and see exactly what Iâ€™m working with, check out the [**XeroLinux Site**](https://xerolinux.xyz/gear/).
