#### How To Contact me.

There are many ways to contact me. Just make sure to select the right method. I will answer you as fast as I can, all i ask for is a little bit of *patience*. I will try my best to answer. If I don't, it just means I am either too busy or power is out as it usually is here in **Lebanon**. ;)

#### Linux Related

Ok, so, if you want to ask questions related to **Linux** or more specifically [**XeroLinux Toolkit**](https://xerolinux.xyz), you can do so by either joining the [**XeroLinux Forum**](https://forum.xerolinux.xyz) or via the [**Mastodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) instance. Project also has a [**YouTube Channel**](https://youtube.com/@XeroLinux). ;)

#### Everything else

For everything else, you can contact me privately via my personal [**Mastodon**](https://mastodon.social/@techxero). That's the only place for that. I am not available anywhere else for private issues as I am mostly working on my Toolkit these days.

#### Support

If you want to support me financially during my country's worst **Economic Crisis** in decades, there are 3 ways to do so currently. You can either do it via [**Fundraizr**](https://fundrazr.com/xerolinux), [**Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/xerolinux) or by becoming a [**Github-Sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/xerolinux)
