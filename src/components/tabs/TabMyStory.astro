      YouTube Channel &mdash; IRL Updates
    </h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
      I created a brand new YouTube Channel where I upload <strong class="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">IRL Updates</strong> —
      real, unfiltered moments from my life. Making that first video was incredibly challenging. It wasn't just about
      hitting the record button, it was about opening up and talking about some uncomfortable, deeply personal subjects.
      In doing so, I really laid myself bare, exposing parts of my story that I don't usually share.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
      This channel is more than just a place for videos; it's a space where I hope to connect on a genuine level,
      to be vulnerable, and to explore life's ups and downs with all of you.

      Living in Lebanon has been incredibly difficult, especially in recent years. I used to work for
      <strong class="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">Apple</strong> in <strong class="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">Ireland</strong>,
      but even then, I struggled with depression and financial difficulties because of the high cost of living.
      After the <strong class="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">Beirut port explosion</strong>, I tried to take
      leave to support my family, but that was a challenge in itself.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
      I remember hearing the explosion live as I was on the phone with my father — it was a terrifying and traumatic
      moment. Eventually, I returned home despite the currency devaluation, which wiped out more than 90% of the
      Lebanese pound's value and cut salaries drastically. Finding work locally has been almost impossible despite
      my experience, and everyday life has only gotten harder.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
      Through every hardship, I hold onto the belief that persistence and honesty can pave the way for better days.
      My journey is far from over, and every small step forward is a victory worth celebrating. I am grateful for
      the support I have received so far and hopeful for the future — that creativity, community, and courage can
      thrive even in the toughest circumstances.
